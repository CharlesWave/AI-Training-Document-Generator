## Stage 1: let Gemini list out all the training-related details from the video
stage_1_prompt100 = '''
##Role
You are an expert at creating corporate training documents for SOP, bes practices, technology guide, etc. 

##Task
User will provide you with a company's training video. Your task is to create a training document that covers all the training knowledge points from the video. Follow the instructions below.

##Instructions
1. Summarize the training video content. Your summary should include the context and/or objective of the training, key topics and key takwaways.

2. Write down EVERY **training knowledge point** in the order as they are discussed in the video.
    - User should be able to understand everything training-related from the video by just reading your training document.
    - For a knowledge point is repeated through a session, DO NOT write it down multiple times.
    - DO NOT include irrelevant details from the video that are not related to the training.

##Output requirement
Format your output into a JSON object with below keys:
- summary
- knowledge_points: return a LIST that contains all the knowledge points written down in step 2

## Stage 2: let Gemini select relevant screenshots for each knowledge point. Call API 3 times.
stage_2_prompt100 = '''
##Role
You are an expert at creating corporate training documents for SOP, bes practices, technology guide, etc. 

##Context
Below is a summary of a video training session. 
{{summary_from_stage_1}}

##Task
User will provide you the original video training session, and a list of training knowledge points.
Your task is to provide timestamps of the video for taking screenshots to demonstrate each knowledge point.

##Instructions
For each knowledge point, list out timestamps of relevant screenshots in the video.
- You can provide multiple timestamps if multiple screenshots added together can better demonstrate the knowledge point. 
- However, DO NOT list multiple timestamps for screenshots with minimal difference and don't convey information (e.g. movement of cursor or finish writing a sentence). Each screenshot MUST add value to demonstrating the knowledge point.
- If the video doesn't have suitable screenshot for a detail, return an empty list for that detail. This condition applies when the speaker is talking about the knowledge point but the video doesn't show relevant content.

**Bottom Line**: User should be able to better understand the training knowledge points with the screenshots you selected. But DO NOT select irrelevant or redundant screenshots.


##Output requirement
Format your output into a **LIST** of key-value pairs. 
- The key is the index of a knowledge point in the list user provided. The index starts from 0.
- The value is a list of timestamps of relevant screenshots selected for demonstrating the knowledge point.
<example>
[
  {
    "0": [
      "0:16",
      "0:21"
    ]
  },
  {
    "1": [
      "0:47",
      "0:52"
    ]
  },
  {
    "2": [
      "0:59",
      "1:02"
    ]
  },
  ...
]
</example>
** The output list length (i.e. number of key-value pairs) MUST be the same as the list length of user provided knowledge points. **

## Stage 3: let o1 select relevant screenshots for each knowledge point. 
# The screenshots are provided with indexes in the format of "{knowledge_point_index}_{screenshot_index}_{api_attempt_index}".
stage_3_prompt100 = '''
##Role
You are an expert at creating corporate training documents for SOP, bes practices, technology guide, etc. 

##Context
Below is a summary of a video training session. 
    {{summary_from_stage_1}}
User will provide you a knowledge point of the video training session, and some screenshots from the video as well as the screenshot indexes. 
    - The screenshots are selected by 3 LLM API calls separately for demonstrating the same knowledge point, and therefore many of them are very similar or identical.
    - The screenshot indexes are in the format of "(knowledge_point_index)_(screenshot_index)_(api_attempt_index)" (index starts from 1).

##Task
Your task is to curate the most relevant screenshots to demonstrate the knowledge point, and provide captions. Follow the instructions below.

##Instructions
1. Group the screenshots into groups of similar or identical screenshots. You can form one group or many groups depending on the similarity of the screenshots.

2. Select screenshots from each group that together can best demonstrate the knowledge point. 
    - You should select at most 1 screenshot from each group. The goal is to avoid selecting multiple screenshots with minimal difference and don't convey information (e.g. movement of cursor or finish writing a sentence). 
    - Every screenshot selected should add value to demonstrate the knowledge point.

3. For each screenshot selected, provide a caption that helps demonstrate the knowledge point.

##Output requirement
Format your output into a LIST of key-value pairs. They keys are:
- groups: a nested list of screenshot indexes. Each child list is the indexes of a group of similar screenshots.
- selected_indexes: a list of the indexes of selected screenshots.
- caption: a list of captions for the selected screenshots.
<example 1>
{
    "groups": [["1_1_1", "1_1_2", "1_1_3"], ["1_2_2", "1_2_3"]],
    "selected_indexes": ["1_1_2", "1_2_3"],
    "captions": ["{ how screenshot 1_1_2 demonstrate the knowlegde point }", "{ how screenshot 1_2_3 demonstrate the knowlegde point }"]
}
</example 1>

<example 2>
{
    "groups": [["2_1_1","2_1_2", "2_1_3", "2_2_3"], ["2_2_1","2_2_2", "2_3_3"], ["2_3_1","2_3_2", "2_4_3"]],
    "selected_indexes": ["2_1_1", "2_3_3", "2_3_2"],
    "captions": ["{ how screenshot 2_1_1 demonstrate the knowlegde point }", "{ how screenshot 2_3_3 demonstrate the knowlegde point }", "{ how screenshot 2_3_2 demonstrate the knowlegde point }"]
}
</example 2>
